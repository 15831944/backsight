Backsight is a data entry system for creating a cadastral database from a set of hardcopy plans. It was originally developed 10 years ago using C++ for the Province of Manitoba in Canada. A revised object model is now being implemented in C#.

The longer-term goal is to provide an enterprise solution for managing the cadastral fabric of a country.
